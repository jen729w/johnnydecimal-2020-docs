    <JDH1>Keeping notes</JDH1>

    <p>
      So far, weâ€™ve mostly thought about using this system as somewhere to keep
      your files.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what if you didnâ€™t always have to write things in a Word document or
      create an Excel spreadsheet? What if you had a place where you could keep
      little notes about things?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if it was super amazing quick so you could find anything instantly?
    </p>

    <Header size="large" dividing className={styles.headerLarge_bordered}>
      Become ludicrously efficient
    </Header>

    <p>
      What Iâ€™m about to show you is probably my favourite use of the
      Johnny.Decimal system.{' '}
      <strong>
        Start using this at work and watch your productivity go through the
        roof.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <Header size="large" dividing className={styles.headerLarge_bordered}>
      What, and why?
    </Header>

    <p>
      Take our{' '}
      <span className={styles.johnnyDecimal_boxed}>22.02 Office lease</span>{' '}
      example from before. Itâ€™s great that we can store those documents in a
      place where we can find them again, but thereâ€™s probably stuff related to
      the lease that you donâ€™t have in a document anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was the phone number of the lawyer that you used? The reference
      number of the bank transaction when you paid the deposit? Maybe a list of
      stuff you still need to do to complete the job?
    </p>

    <p>
      You <em>could</em> store that stuff in a Word document, but that would be
      a hideous waste of time. Word takes ages to open, and itâ€™s really hard to
      search through all of your Word docs simultaneously.

    <JDH1>Use Simplenote</JDH1>

    <p>
      You need some software. Itâ€™s free and available for every device you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Itâ€™s called <a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a>
      <sup>1</sup>. Download it right now, or log in and use it online.
    </p>

    <div className={styles.footnote}>
      <sup>1.</sup>&nbsp;If youâ€™re in a corporate environment and canâ€™t install
      software, or donâ€™t want to connect your stuff to â€˜the cloudâ€™, there are
      other excellent options available â€“ see 'Advanced note taking apps',
      below.
    </div>

    <Header size="large" dividing className={styles.headerLarge_bordered}>
      32.18 Oh, wow! A note

      Thatâ€™s it.{' '}
      <strong>
        We keep notes here, and we start them with the Johnny.Decimal number.{' '}

      Hopefully one of those cartoon lightbulbs just went off in your head. ðŸ’¡

    <p>
      Simplenote is generally excellent because you can use the search function
      to filter your notes and show those that match. Thatâ€™s brilliant. But
      whatâ€™s more brilliant is this.
    </p>

    <Header size="large" dividing className={styles.headerLarge_bordered}>
      I only want to see things related to Contracts
    </Header>

    <p>
      Imagine this when you have hundreds of notes.{' '}
      <strong>
        You can instantly filter to show only those notes related to a specific
        category by typing three characters.
      </strong>{' '}
      It doesnâ€™t matter what the titles of those notes are, because theyâ€™re
      categorised by number already.
    </p>

    <Image
      src={simplenote_search_22}
      bordered
      rounded
      alt="Simplenote window with a search for the term '22' selected"
      style={{ width: '648px', marginBottom: '20px' }}
    />

    <p>
      Of course you can <em>combine</em> this with the standard text search that
      Simplenote provides. This allows you to narrow down your notes instantly.
      Say you have notes referring to â€˜client XYZâ€™ all through your system (as
      well as notes about your other clients), but you only want to see â€˜any
      contract stuff related to client XYZâ€™. Just type{' '}
      <span className={styles.johnnyDecimal_boxed}>22. XYZ</span> in the
      Simplenote search box.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hereâ€™s what I personally use â€“ but donâ€™t mess about here if youâ€™re a
      beginner, Simplenote does the job. Come back when youâ€™re <em>really</em>{' '}
      comfortable with how all this works.

    <p>
      For Windows,{' '}
      <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html">Resophnotes</a> runs
      without administrator privileges and will store files locally. It{' '}
      <em>can</em> sync to Simplenote, but Iâ€™ve never tried it. Itâ€™s a bit rough
      around the edges but itâ€™s real fast. This is what I use every day if Iâ€™m
      working in a corporate environment. Free.
    </p>

    <Header size="medium" dividing>
      At home (or if you work on a Mac)
    </Header>

    <p>
      For Mac, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> is
      what I use. It synchronises to Simplenote and is quick and simple, but
      itâ€™s ancient now and isnâ€™t being updated. The developers are working on{' '}
      <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a>, which Iâ€™ll buy the instant
      itâ€™s available.
    </p>

    <p>
      For iOS, <a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> has an app. There
      are tons of other options â€“ see{' '}
      <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>, or just search the App
      Store. As long as it synchronises and allows quick search of all of your
      notes, itâ€™ll work.
